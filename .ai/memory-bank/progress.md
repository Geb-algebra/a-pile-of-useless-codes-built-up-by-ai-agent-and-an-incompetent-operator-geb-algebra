# Progress

## What Works

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Basic project structure is in place
   - Development environment is configured
   - Build and deployment pipelines are set up

2. **Domain Model**:
   - Core domain models for the modeling domain are defined
   - Factory classes for creating domain objects are implemented
   - Repository classes for data persistence are implemented
   - Unit tests for factories and repositories are in place

3. **Routing**:
   - Basic routing structure is set up with React Router
   - Simple routes are defined

## What's Left to Build

1. **LLM Integration**:
   - Models, factories, and repositories for the LLM domain
   - Integration with an LLM provider
   - Prompt engineering for domain knowledge extraction
   - Conversation flow for clarifying questions

2. **User Interface**:
   - Input form for business operations
   - Review and refinement interface for ubiquitous language and use cases
   - Domain model visualization
   - Interactive refinement of the domain model
   - Export functionality

3. **Business Logic**:
   - Services for manipulating domain objects
   - Logic for deriving domain models from user input
   - Logic for refining domain models based on user feedback

4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for the complete flow
   - User documentation
   - Developer documentation

## Current Status

The project is in the initial development phase. The foundation has been laid with the core domain model and infrastructure, but the main functionality for domain modeling has not yet been implemented.

The next major milestone is to implement the LLM domain and begin developing the user interface for the domain modeling process.

## Known Issues

1. **Empty LLM Domain**:
   - The `llm` domain directory exists but has no implementation yet
   - Need to decide on the approach for LLM integration

2. **Minimal UI**:
   - The current UI is minimal and does not support the domain modeling process
   - Need to design and implement the user interface

3. **Client-Side Storage Limitations**:
   - Using localforage for client-side storage may have limitations for large domain models
   - May need to consider alternative storage solutions

4. **No Export Functionality**:
   - The functionality to export the domain model as markdown is not yet implemented
   - Need to design the export format and implement the export functionality
