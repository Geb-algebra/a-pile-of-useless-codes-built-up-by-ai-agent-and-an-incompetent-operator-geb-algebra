# Progress

## What Works

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Basic project structure is in place
   - Development environment is configured
   - Build and deployment pipelines are set up

2. **Domain Model**:
   - Core domain models for the modeling domain are defined
   - Factory classes for creating domain objects are implemented
   - Repository classes for data persistence are implemented
   - Unit tests for factories and repositories are in place

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Models, factories, repositories, and services for the LLM domain are implemented
   - Integration with Anthropic Claude as the LLM provider
   - API keys are passed directly to service methods for improved security
   - Prompt engineering for domain knowledge extraction
   - Conversation flow for clarifying questions

4. **Business Logic**:
   - Services for manipulating domain objects are implemented
   - Logic for deriving domain models from user input using LLMs
   - Logic for refining domain models based on user feedback using LLMs

5. **Routing**:
   - Basic routing structure is set up with React Router
   - Simple routes are defined

## What's Left to Build

1. **User Interface**:
   - Input form for business operations
   - Review and refinement interface for ubiquitous language and use cases
   - Domain model visualization
   - Interactive refinement of the domain model
   - Export functionality

2. **Export Functionality**:
   - Refine the implementation of the markdown export
   - Implement the diagram generation functionality
   - Design a clear and useful format for the exported model

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Integration tests for the complete flow
   - End-to-end tests for the application
   - User documentation
   - Developer documentation

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of the LLM domain and the integration with the modeling services. The core functionality for domain modeling using LLMs is now in place at the services layer.

The next major milestone is to develop the user interface for the domain modeling process, which will allow users to interact with the application and leverage the LLM-powered domain modeling capabilities.

## Known Issues

1. **Minimal UI**:
   - The current UI is minimal and does not support the domain modeling process
   - Need to design and implement the user interface

2. **Client-Side Storage Limitations**:
   - Using localforage for client-side storage may have limitations for large domain models
   - May need to consider alternative storage solutions

3. **Export Functionality**:
   - The export functionality is currently implemented with placeholders
   - Need to refine the export format and implement the full functionality

4. **LLM Provider Dependencies**:
   - The application depends on the Anthropic LLM API
   - Need to handle API rate limits, errors, and fallbacks
