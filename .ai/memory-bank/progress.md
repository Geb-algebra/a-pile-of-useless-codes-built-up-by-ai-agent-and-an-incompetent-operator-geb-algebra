# Progress

## What Works

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Basic project structure is in place
   - Development environment is configured
   - Build and deployment pipelines are set up

2. **Domain Model**:
   - Core domain models for the modeling domain are defined
   - Factory classes for creating domain objects are implemented
   - Repository classes for data persistence are implemented
   - Unit tests for factories and repositories are in place

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Models, factories, repositories, and services for the LLM domain are implemented
   - Integration with Anthropic Claude as the primary LLM provider
   - API keys are passed directly to service methods for improved security
   - Prompt engineering for domain knowledge extraction
   - Conversation flow for clarifying questions
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all LLM components

4. **Business Logic**:
   - Services for manipulating domain objects are implemented
   - Logic for deriving domain models from user input using LLMs
   - Logic for refining domain models based on user feedback using LLMs
   - Integration between modeling services and LLM services

5. **Routing**:
   - Basic routing structure is set up with React Router
   - Simple routes are defined for application navigation

## What's Left to Build

1. **User Interface**:
   - Input form for business operations
   - Review and refinement interface for ubiquitous language and use cases
   - Domain model visualization and interaction
   - Interactive refinement of the domain model
   - Export interface for downloading results
   - State management between steps of the domain modeling process

2. **Export Functionality**:
   - Refine the implementation of the markdown export
   - Implement the diagram generation functionality
   - Design a clear and useful format for the exported model
   - Consider visualization options for the domain model

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Integration tests for the complete flow
   - End-to-end tests for the application
   - Test with different LLM providers and configurations
   - User documentation
   - Developer documentation

4. **Error Handling and Resilience**:
   - Robust error handling for LLM API calls
   - Fallback mechanisms for when LLM responses are insufficient
   - Rate limiting and quota management for LLM usage

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of the LLM domain and the integration with the modeling services. The core functionality for domain modeling using LLMs is now in place at the services layer, with comprehensive test coverage for all components.

The LLM domain has been implemented with a direct API key passing strategy, focusing on Anthropic Claude as the primary provider. The modeling services have been updated to use the LLM domain for extracting ubiquitous language, use cases, and generating domain models.

The next major milestone is to develop the user interface for the domain modeling process, which will allow users to interact with the application and leverage the LLM-powered domain modeling capabilities.

## Known Issues

1. **Minimal UI**:
   - The current UI is minimal and does not support the complete domain modeling process
   - Need to design and implement the full user interface

2. **Client-Side Storage Limitations**:
   - Using localforage for client-side storage may have limitations for large domain models
   - May need to consider alternative storage solutions for more complex use cases

3. **Export Functionality**:
   - The export functionality is currently implemented with placeholders
   - Need to refine the export format and implement the full functionality
   - Need to design a clear and useful format for the exported model

4. **LLM Provider Dependencies**:
   - The application depends on the Anthropic LLM API
   - Need to handle API rate limits, errors, and fallbacks
   - Need to ensure consistent responses across different providers
   - Need to consider monitoring and analytics for LLM usage
