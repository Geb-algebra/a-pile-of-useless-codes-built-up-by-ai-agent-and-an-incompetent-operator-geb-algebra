# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The Domain Modeler project is in its development phase. The core domain model for the modeling domain has been established, and the LLM domain has been implemented with the following components:

- Domain models defined in `models.ts` for both modeling and LLM domains
- Factory classes for creating domain objects in `factories.ts`
- Repository classes for data persistence in `repositories.ts`
- Service classes for business logic in `services.ts`
- Unit tests for all components

The application currently has a minimal UI with a basic route structure, and the core functionality for domain modeling using LLMs has been implemented in the services layer.

## Recent Changes

1. Implemented the LLM domain:
   - Created models for LLM configurations, prompts, and responses
   - Implemented factories for creating LLM configurations and prompts
   - Implemented repositories for persisting LLM configurations
   - Implemented services for interacting with the Anthropic LLM provider

2. Integrated LLM with domain modeling services:
   - Updated ModelExtractionService to use LLMs for extracting ubiquitous language, use cases, and generating clarifying questions
   - Updated ModelGenerationService to use LLMs for generating domain models
   - Updated ModelRefinementService to use LLMs for refining domain models and generating refinement suggestions

3. Updated the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the LLM domain implementation:
   - Modified the approach to use API key passing instead of BYOK strategy
   - Focused the implementation on Anthropic Claude as the primary LLM provider
   - Updated the interface between the LLM domain and the modeling domain
   - Outlined the consequences and risks of the chosen approach

4. Added comprehensive unit tests for all components:
   - Tests for LLM factories, repositories, and services
   - Tests for domain modeling services with LLM integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **LLM Integration Strategy**:
   - Implemented a client-side approach where API keys are passed directly to service methods
   - API keys are not stored in local storage, improving security
   - Currently supporting Anthropic Claude as the LLM provider

2. **UI Design**:
   - Need to design the user interface for the domain modeling process
   - Need to implement the step-by-step flow described in the project brief

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Currently using localforage for client-side storage
   - Need to consider if this is sufficient or if server-side storage will be needed

4. **Export Format**:
   - The ExportService has placeholder implementations for generating markdown and diagrams
   - Need to refine the export format and implement the full functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Develop the User Interface**:
   - Create the main application flow
   - Implement the input form for business operations
   - Implement the review and refinement interface for ubiquitous language and use cases
   - Implement the domain model visualization and interaction

2. **Refine the Export Functionality**:
   - Implement the full functionality to export the domain model as markdown
   - Implement the diagram generation functionality
   - Design a clear and useful format for the exported model

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Implement integration tests for the complete flow
   - Perform end-to-end testing of the application
   - Validate the application with real-world domain modeling scenarios

4. **Deployment and Documentation**:
   - Deploy the application to production
   - Create user documentation
   - Create developer documentation
