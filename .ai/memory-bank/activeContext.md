# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The Domain Modeler project is in its initial development phase. The core domain model for the modeling domain has been established with the following components:

- Domain models defined in `models.ts`
- Factory classes for creating domain objects in `factories.ts`
- Repository classes for data persistence in `repositories.ts`
- Unit tests for factories and repositories

The application currently has a minimal UI with a basic route structure, but the main functionality for domain modeling has not yet been implemented.

## Recent Changes

1. Established the core domain model for the modeling domain:
   - Defined types for UbiquitousLanguage, UseCase, Entity, ValueObject, Aggregate, Event, and Command
   - Implemented factories for creating these domain objects
   - Implemented repositories for persisting these domain objects using localforage

2. Set up the project structure following DDD principles:
   - Created a dedicated directory for each domain
   - Established the pattern of models, factories, repositories, and services

3. Configured the development environment:
   - Set up React Router for routing
   - Configured Tailwind CSS and CSS modules for styling
   - Set up testing with Vitest

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **LLM Integration Strategy**:
   - The `llm` domain directory has been created but not yet implemented
   - Need to decide on the approach for integrating with LLMs (API calls, client-side models, etc.)
   - Need to design the interface between the LLM and the domain model

2. **UI Design**:
   - Need to design the user interface for the domain modeling process
   - Need to implement the step-by-step flow described in the project brief

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Currently using localforage for client-side storage
   - Need to consider if this is sufficient or if server-side storage will be needed

4. **Export Format**:
   - Need to design the format for exporting the domain model as markdown
   - Need to implement the export functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Implement the LLM Domain**:
   - Create models, factories, repositories, and services for the LLM domain
   - Implement the integration with an LLM provider
   - Design and implement the prompts for extracting domain knowledge

2. **Develop the User Interface**:
   - Create the main application flow
   - Implement the input form for business operations
   - Implement the review and refinement interface for ubiquitous language and use cases
   - Implement the domain model visualization and interaction

3. **Implement Services for Domain Modeling**:
   - Create services for manipulating domain objects
   - Implement the business logic for deriving domain models from user input

4. **Export Functionality**:
   - Implement the functionality to export the domain model as markdown
   - Design a clear and useful format for the exported model

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Perform integration testing of the complete flow
   - Validate the application with real-world domain modeling scenarios
